resnet50
________

**Introduction**

This sample program implements:

1). Use "get_bmodel" to obtain models and images from BITMAIN's official website;

2). Convert resnet50(caffe model) into bmodel;

3). Use C++ interfaces of SAIL to do inference on TPU.

You can execute the script of "test_resnet50.sh" to finish the pipeline directly.
