Choices of Precision
____________________

We now support both FP32 and INT8 computation,
but are related to different products.

If you are using SC3/SE3/SA3, only FP32 is available.
If you are using SC5/SE5/SA5/SA6, both FP32 and INT8 are available.

According to different products and precision, the APIs also have some differences.
Some interfaces only support FP32, and some for INT8, and others for both.
We will point out.

For more information about difference products, please refer to https://sophon.ai
