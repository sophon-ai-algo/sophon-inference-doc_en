Useful Tools
============

We provided some useful tools in "sophon_inference/bin/".
Tool that of soc mode are the subset of pcie mode.
Current tools include:

**1).get_bmodel**

FP32 only.

We stored some widely used deep learning models on our website,
you can use this tool to get them.

usage:

    .. code-block:: shell

       # save_path, the path you want to save the downloaded files.
       # arg, can be one of (model_name, 'model_list', 'test_data', 'all')
       
       get_bmodel -[h] [--save_path SAVE_PATH] arg


**2).split_tf_model**

FP32 only.

Using AutoSplit to split model, let you split model simply.

usage:

    .. code-block:: shell

       split_tf_model  -p your platform:tensorflow/mxnet, now for tensorflow only.
                       -t target directory to save splitted models.
                       -m model path
                       -w weight path
                       -d if dynamic, 0 for static or 1 for dynamic
                       -n input tensor names, splitted by comma, x,x
                       -s input tensor shapes, splitted by comma, (x,x,x,x),(x,x)
                       -o output tensor names, splitted by comma, x,x


**3).test_splitted_tf_model**

FP32 only.

Check if the results produces by splitted models are equal to original results.

usage:

    .. code-block:: shell

       test_splitted_tf_model -p input model dl platform:tensorflow/mxnet, now for tensorflow only.
                              -m input tfmodel path
                              -s input submodel path
